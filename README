Note: this is no longer maintained and is only partially complete. Please see my current project, backup_manager which is a much more comprehensive solution


Backup Daemon, written in C

To compile:
./autogen.sh
./configure
make



Loads config from an INI file, specified as the 2nd command line arg.

ex: backupd /home/user/backupd.ini

backupd expects to find two sections, one labeled SOURCE DIR, the other DESTINATION DIR. Each of 
these should contain one property, PATH which corresponds to the path to either watch or 
backup to, respectively. 

An example is presented for clarity.

; a backupd ini file
[SOURCE DIR]
PATH=/home/user/important_dir

[DESTINATION DIR]
PATH=/home/user/backup_mount



As files are modified, created, etc in the source directory, the changes will be appropriately
reflected in the destination directory.
